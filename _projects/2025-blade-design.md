To test our knowledge of wind turbine dynamics, fluid mechanics, and mechanical design, our group designed wind turbine blades with optimized power generation at low wind speeds. Many constraints of this design came from the wind tunnel in which we tested our turbine. The objective was to maximize power output under a realistic Weibull wind distribution while meeting strict geometric, structural, and operational constraints. These included compatibility with a standard hub, a maximum blade length of 6 inches, a width limit of 2 inches, and a rotational speed cap of 2000 RPM. Material limits from Accura 25 resin further constrained the design, requiring conservative stress margins to ensure safe operation.

The design process combined an iterative optimum-rotor method with blade element theory implemented in MATLAB. Using a NACA 4412 airfoil, we optimized chord, twist, and pitch distributions along the blade span for a target wind speed of 4.167 m/s, derived from the cubic power-weighted Weibull distribution. Initial designs at higher rotational speeds exceeded allowable stress limits, leading to an iterative reduction in operating speed. The final design operated at 1100 RPM with a tip speed ratio of 4.21, producing stresses over two orders of magnitude below the material failure limit while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency.
Experimental validation was conducted in a wind tunnel using a controlled torque-sweep testing procedure to generate power curves at multiple wind speeds near the design point. Wind speed, RPM, torque, voltage, and current were recorded to compute mechanical power output across operating conditions. While the blades demonstrated excellent structural performance with no visible damage, the turbine exhibited unstable behavior below ~1500 RPM, preventing validation at the intended operating speed. Power peaks instead occurred at higher wind speeds, revealing a mismatch between theoretical optimization and experimental behavior. These results provided valuable insight into low-RPM turbine dynamics and highlighted areas for future improvement, including modeling of tip losses and wake effects.

In this project, I specifically handled the data analysis. I made the graph of the power curves and found the estimated turbine efficiencies at different wind speeds so that we could evaluate how our design did. Handling the data, I was also able to point out potential errors or experimental mishaps in our data, like the strange behavior at ~1500 RPM.

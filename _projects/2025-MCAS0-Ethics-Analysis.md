The Boeing 737 MAX crisis illustrates how technical decisions in engineering are inseparable from ethical responsibility. The implementation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS, was intended to improve aircraft handling characteristics, yet its design, communication, and certification raised serious ethical concerns. The handwritten worksheet analyses emphasize that the core ethical failure was not a single software bug, but a systemic breakdown in prioritizing public safety, transparency, and professional accountability.

One major ethical concern highlighted in the worksheets is Boeing’s decision to design MCAS to rely on a single angle of attack sensor. From an engineering ethics perspective, this choice violated the obligation to anticipate failure modes in safety critical systems. The worksheets note that engineers are expected to design with redundancy when human lives are at stake, particularly in aviation systems where sensor failure is a known risk. By allowing a single faulty input to repeatedly command nose down trim, MCAS transformed a manageable sensor error into a catastrophic hazard.

Another ethical issue discussed in the handwritten work is the lack of transparency provided to pilots and airlines. MCAS was largely undocumented in pilot manuals and training materials. The worksheets argue that withholding this information undermined informed decision making in the cockpit and shifted risk onto pilots who were unaware of the system’s authority and behavior. Ethical engineering requires honest communication about system limitations and risks, especially when end users must respond under extreme time pressure.

These failures directly conflict with the AMSE or ASME canons of ethics. The first canon states that engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. In the case of MCAS, business pressures to compete with Airbus and avoid costly pilot retraining appear to have taken precedence over conservative safety design. The worksheets emphasize that ethical responsibility does not disappear under organizational pressure, and engineers have a duty to raise concerns or resist decisions that compromise safety.

Additionally, the canon requiring engineers to issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner is relevant. The certification process and early communications following the first crash minimized MCAS’s role, delaying broader recognition of the systemic problem. This eroded trust in both Boeing and the regulatory framework meant to protect the public. As the worksheets note, ethical engineering depends on accountability not only after failures occur, but during design, testing, and certification.

The MCAS case demonstrates that ethical engineering is not limited to technical correctness. It requires proactive safety design, transparency with users, and adherence to professional canons even when they conflict with financial or organizational goals. The handwritten analyses underscore that the tragedy of the 737 MAX was preventable, and that ethical responsibility in engineering must be treated as integral to design, not as an afterthought.
